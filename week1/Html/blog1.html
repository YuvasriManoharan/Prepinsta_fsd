            <p><strong>Full Stack Development</strong> is the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end parts of an application. It involves a broad skill set that includes working with databases, server-side logic, client-side scripting, and user interface design.</p>
            <p>A <strong>full stack developer</strong> is proficient in handling a wide range of tasks, from creating a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to developing complex server-side logic using frameworks like <abbr title="Node.js">Node.js</abbr>, and managing databases using <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> or <abbr title="Not Only SQL">NoSQL</abbr> technologies. This versatility allows full stack developers to build complete web applications and handle every aspect of the development process.</p>

            <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Front-end development</strong> focuses on the user interface and user experience aspects of a web application. It involves creating the layout, design, and interactive elements that users see and interact with in their web browser. Technologies commonly used in front-end development include HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Front-end developers often work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build dynamic and responsive applications.</p>
           

            <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

 The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
                
You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
                
 The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
            <p><strong>Back-end development</strong> is concerned with the server side of a web application. It involves writing server-side logic, managing databases, and handling client requests. Back-end developers work with programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, and JavaScript (using Node.js) to build the server-side functionality of an application. They also manage databases using SQL-based systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or NoSQL systems like MongoDB.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
            <p><strong>Full stack development</strong> combines both front-end and back-end development skills. A full stack developer is capable of building a complete web application from start to finish. They can design the user interface, write server-side code, and manage databases, ensuring that all parts of the application work seamlessly together. This holistic approach to development allows for better integration of technologies and a more cohesive development process.</p>
            <p>Full stack developers are valuable assets to development teams because they can understand and contribute to every part of the project. Their ability to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end development makes them versatile and adaptable, capable of tackling a wide range of tasks and challenges.</p>

            <h2>Sample Code Snippets</h2>

            <h3>Example: Basic Node.js Server</h3>
            <pre><code>
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World!');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Example: React Component</h3>
            <pre><code>
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, React!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a sample React component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
            </code></pre>
